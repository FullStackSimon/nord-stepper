# Nord Themes

The themes package found from `packages/themes` utilizes simple SCSS files and CSS Custom Properties. [Gulp.js](https://gulpjs.com) is used to transform SCSS into CSS.

The following are the most commonly used commands during development:

- `pnpm start` - Compile themes, start watching for changes.
- `pnpm build` - Builds the project.
- `pnpm lint` - Run linting.
